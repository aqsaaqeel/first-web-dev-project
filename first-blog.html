            <h1 id="blog-mainheading">Why is <span id= add-color>.com</span> the most used domain name</h1>
            <h3 id="blog-subheading">How it started?</h2>
                <p class="blog-paragraph">.com derives its name from the word commercial because originally it was
                    created to be used by organisations for commercial purposes.
                    It was started in 1985 and administered by United States Department of Defense, now it is under
                    Verisign.
                    It is a top-level domain(TLD).

                    Although .com is one of the first domains, there were other top level domains available since a long
                    time like edu, gov,
                    net, org, etc but .com is the largest top-level domain.
                    Today, roughly 52% of websites use .com which leads us to the question as to why and how has it
                    garnered such popularity.

                </p>
                <h3 id="blog-subheading">Why is it more preferred over the others?</h2>
                    <p id="blog-paragraph">When making a website, choosing domains are as important as choosing the
                        website’s name.
                        It can have a lot of effect on a website’s traffic.
                        When users see your website, the only way they can come back is through the URL.
                        Our brains have become wired into thinking that most websites end with .com domain that whenever
                        we are searching
                        for a website, we search for a .com one. It is also speculated that Google SEO tends to rank
                        these websites
                        higher because they are readable, recognisable and trustworthy..
                    </p>
                    <p id="blog-paragraph">The simple reason for this could be that it is one of the oldest and reliable
                        domains.
                        Seeing a website end with .com may just give off the vibe of authority.
                        We can think of a scenario where a person can not get a .com domain with their preferred URL so
                        they go for a lesser known domain.
                        A problem that arises is that when someone searches for that person’s website they are bound to
                        search for their website name with a .com suffix and it ends up leading them to some other
                        website.
                        Thereby, decreasing this person’s website traffic.</p>
                    <p id="blog-paragraph">We know that most websites are used for commercial purposes so a .com domain
                        sounds appropriate for that.
                        There are country based domain names available but to someone from a different country it may
                        not sound inclusive.

                        At the end of the day, a person can choose a domain according to their own needs.
                        For example, a government scholarship portal will sound more appropriate with that country’s
                        domain name.
                        But it is needless to say that for general purposes, .com definitely has an upper hand over its
                        peers.
