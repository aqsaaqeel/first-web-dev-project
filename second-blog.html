            <h1 id="blog-mainheading"><span id= add-color>Bootcamps</span> - Are they a replacement for the traditional college degrees?</h1>
                <p class="blog-paragraph">According to a wikipedia article on ‘Engineering education in India’, 
                    “As of 2021, India annually produces one million engineering graduates.” It is more than the population of Bhutan.
                     It is also estimated that only 5% of all the engineering graduates every year have the proper skill set required to land
                      them a job. It is not as if the demand is less than the supply. But because of the influx of below average private 
                      engineering colleges, a student ends up being lost in the herd.
                     That is where the bootcamps come in the picture.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-paragraph">
                    Where a typical college degree takes about 4 years, boot camps in the short span of 2-6 months prepares a student 
                    with the right skillset in landing them a job.
                     Let us dive into all the aspects of bootcamps and how it differs from college.
                </p>
                <h3 id="blog-subheading">Time commitment</h3>
                    <p id="blog-paragraph">As mentioned above, bootcamps run for 2-6 months which may require full time commitment.
                         There are part time boot camps also available and ones with durations as less as a week.
                        On the other hand, a computer science college degree is typically of 4 years which is a big commitment.
                        
                    </p>

                    <h3 id="blog-subheading">Cost</h3>
                    <p id="blog-paragraph">When it comes to cost effectiveness, bootcamps win the battle.
                         The fee structure can be less than a college’s one semester fee. NeoG camp, a web 
                         development bootcamp in India has 30,000 INR as their total fee.

                         Some bootcamps do not even require you to pay the fees upfront, they have policies where 
                         you have to pay the fees only after you have acquired a job of a certain threshold package.
                         Masai school in India is one such boot camp where you have to pay the total amount of 3 lakh INR
                          only after getting a job above 5LPA.                      
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="blog-subheading">Skillset</h3>
                    <p id="blog-paragraph">A boot camp focuses on helping a student hone a particular skill which is 
                        very beneficial for industrial standards as it makes you job ready in a short span. 

                        College curriculum is more open, with details about the how and why of the programming domain.                      
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="blog-subheading">Opportunities</h3>
                    <p id="blog-paragraph">There are some companies which have a Computer science degree as a requirement before applying for jobs.
                         And since a bootcamp is not accredited, it is not equivalent to a degree. However, 
                        in cases where practical work is a criteria for acquiring a job, a bootcamp student is just as eligible as a high performing CS student.                        
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="blog-subheading">Conclusion</h3>
                    <p id="blog-paragraph">It all comes down to what a person really wants. To a person without financial stability boot camps could help 
                        them with a kickstarter.
                         But if you want to acquire in-depth knowledge of computers for research, a college degree can not be replaced.
